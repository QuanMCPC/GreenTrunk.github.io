        <h1>
          Do we really know the correct Speed of Light and how it affects us?
        </h1>
        <p>
          The speed of the light, which is 299,792,458 m/s, has not been proven.
          This may seem absurd but, for centuries, the scientists have used a
          mirror to measure the Two-Way Speed of Light.
        </p>
        <p>
          This means the light bounces off a plane mirror and then comes back to
          the source which makes the light cover the same path two times. After
          which, a device is used to measure the time taken and displays the
          mean time. Consider this - Does the Light really travel at the same
          speed in different directions and how do we even know?
        </p>
        <p>
          How could this even affect us? We know that the light from Mars takes
          10 mins to reach us on earth and vice versa. Suppose we have an
          astronaut named Jim on Mars and the Space Control Centre on Earth,
          trying to time their clocks. The Space Centre sends a message to Jim,
          saying - "Hey, it's 6:00 here" which takes 20 mins to reach Mars in
          our scenario instead of the 10 minutes conventional time. Jim gets the
          message at 6:20, but thinking that it took 10 mins for the message to
          travel to him, sets his clock to 6:10. He, then, sends the message
          back to earth saying - "Ok, it's 6:10 here". But, assuming that the
          light travels at different speeds in different directions, the message
          instantaneouly reaches Earth at 6:20. The scientists, knowing that it
          took 10 mins for the message to reach Earth, think that the clocks
          have been timed accurately while the clock on Mars lags behind by 10
          minutes!
        </p>
        <p>
          It may and can be possible that light travels at different speeds in
          different directions. After all, Our solar system and different
          celestial bodies along with The Milky - Way Galaxy is revolving around
          the Super Massive Central BlackHole - Sagittarius A. This may
          drastically affect the speed at which the light moves.
