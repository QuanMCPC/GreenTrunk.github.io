        <h1>Number Guessing Program In Python</h1>
        <p >
          This is one of the programs I have made and uploaded on my gist pages.
          It is basically a complete number guess program which makes you start
          it yourself. It also gives you hint whether the number you are trying
          to guess is larger or smaller than the actual answer. This took a long
          time to make and revise, probably days.
        </p>
        <p>
          It uses two basic modules in Python, namely - Time and Random. The most
          used one in this program is Random Module. It generates random values 
          for the program to work correctly. This is the reason that even though
          a User can see the code while running it, they can never see the number
          in the code before the program ends and they have lost.
          The random functions I have used
          <ul>
            <li>randrange(x, y)</li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
          </ul>
        </p>
