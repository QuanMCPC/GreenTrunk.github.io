    <h1>Why can we Not Prove the Speed of Light even though we know it?</h1>
    <p>
      The speed of the light which is 299,792,458 m/s has not been proven. This
      may seem absurd but for centuries the scientists have used a mirror to
      measure the Two-Way Speed of Light.
    </p>

    <p>
      This means the light bounces off a plane mirror and then comes back to the
      source which makes the light cover the same path two times. After which, a
      device is used to measure the time taken and displays the mean time.

      How could this even affect us? Well, suppose we have an astronaut on Mars
      named Jim and the Space Control Centre on Earth, trying to time their
      clocks. The Space Control Centre sends a message to Jim, saying,"Hey, it's
      6:00 here" which takes 20 mins to reach Mars instead of the 10 minutes
      conventional time. Jim gets the message at 6:20, but thinking that it took
      10 mins for the message to travel to him, sets his clock to 6:10. He,
      then, sends the message back to earth saying,"Ok, it's 6:10 here".. Now
      here's the twist, assuming that the light travels at different speeds in
      different directions, the message instantaneouly reaches Earth at 6:20.
      The scientists, knowing that it takes 10 mins for the message to reach
      Earth, think that the clocks have been timed while the clock on Mars lags
      behind by 10 mins!
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be possible that light travels at different speeds in different
      directions because after all, our galaxy is also always moving along with
      our solar system and different celestial bodies which may drastically
      affect the speed at which the light moves.
