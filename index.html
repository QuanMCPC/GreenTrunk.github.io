    <h1>Why The Speed of Light can't be Proven even though we know it?</h1>
    <article>
      <p>
        The speed of the light, which is 299,792,458 m/s, has not been proven.
        This may seem absurd but, for centuries, the scientists have used a
        mirror to measure the Two-Way Speed of Light.
      </p>
      <p>
        This means the light bounces off a plane mirror and then comes back to
        the source which makes the light cover the same path two times. After
        which, a device is used to measure the time taken and displays the mean
        time. Consider this - Does the Light really travel at the same speed in
        different directions and how do we even know?
      </p>
      <p>
        How could this even affect us? We know that the light from Mars takes 10
        mins to reach us on earth and vice versa. Suppose we have an astronaut
        named Jim on Mars and the Space Control Centre on Earth, trying to time
        their clocks. The Space Centre sends a message to Jim, saying - "Hey,
        it's 6:00 here" which takes 20 mins to reach Mars in our scenario
        instead of the 10 minutes conventional time. Jim gets the message at
        6:20, but thinking that it took 10 mins for the message to travel to
        him, sets his clock to 6:10. He, then, sends the message back to earth
        saying - "Ok, it's 6:10 here". But, assuming that the light travels at
        different speeds in different directions, the message instantaneouly
        reaches Earth at 6:20. The scientists, knowing that it took 10 mins for
        the message to reach Earth, think that the clocks have been timed
        accurately while the clock on Mars lags behind by 10 minutes!

        It may and can be possible that light travels at different speeds in
        different directions. After all, Our solar system and different
        celestial bodies along with The Milky - Way Galaxy is revolving around
        the Super Massive Central BlackHole - Sagittarius A. This may
        drastically affect the speed at which the light moves.
